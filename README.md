**NOTE: If you have a pre 1.2 version of Vimari, you need to manually
update to the latest version as there is a bug in the auto-update code.
Versions post 1.2 will automatically update to the lastest version.**

Vimari - Keyboard Shortcuts extension for Safari
================================================

Vimari is a Safari extension that provides keyboard based navigation.
The code is heavily based on [vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium),
a Chrome extension that provides much more extensive features.

Vimari attempts to provide a lightweight port of vimium to Safari,
taking the best components of vimium and adapting them to Safari.

Usage
-----

### Settings
**Command Prefix** - Modifier key to hold down with your action key. If
you leave it blank you don't need to hold down anything (default
setting).

**Excluded URLs** - Comma separated list of website URLs you don't want
to use vimari with. Requires the exact address right now, e.g.
`https://github.com/` for GitHub. Setting GitHub as excluded will not
exclude any sub-pages such as `https://github.com/about` (this will
change in the near future to be smarter).

**Link Hint Characters** - Allowed characters to be used when generating
link shortcuts.

**Extra detection by cursor style** - Detect clickable links by looking
for HTML elements having cursor style set to "pointer".

**Scroll Size** - How much each scroll will move on the page.

### Keyboard Bindings
These are the default keyboard bindings, they can all be changed in the
settings of the extension. You can find them in
`Preferences->Extensions`.
