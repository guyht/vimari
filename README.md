Vimari is a Safari extension that provides keyboard based navigation.
The code is heavily based on [vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium), a
Chrome extension that provides much more extensive features.

Vimari attempts to provide a lightweight port of vimium to Safari, taking the
best components of vimium and adapting them to Safari.

## Usage

### Settings

**Command Prefix** - Modifier key to hold down with your action key. If
you leave it blank you don't need to hold down anything (default
setting).

**Excluded URLs** - Comma separated list of website URLs you don't want
to use vimari with. To exclude GitHub for example, provide the value
`github.com` or `http://github.com`. It's smart and should handle all
possible domain cases.

**Link Hint Characters** - Allowed characters to be used when generating
link shortcuts.

**Extra detection by cursor style** - Detect clickable links by looking
for HTML elements having cursor style set to "pointer".

**Scroll Size** - How much each scroll will move on the page.
