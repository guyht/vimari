:rotating_light: **Attention!** We are currently blocked from releasing new
version of this extension, and we have a proposal solving this problem
:rotating_light:

**For full context, read [the full proposal](/docs/crowdfunding.md).**

## Proposal

I propose we use [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com) as a crowdfunding platform in order
to collect $99 for a ADP membership to be registered in my name (Simon
Egersand).

## If we reach our goal

If we reach the goal and successfully raise all the money we need, what
happens? First of all, I will register my account for a ADP membership and then
make all the changes required to publish the extension to the Safari Extension
Gallery (some changes are required, see
[#100](https://github.com/guyht/vimari/issues/100)). But what happens after
that?

I commit to being active in maintaining this extension for the next year. That
means I will work on fixing bugs, developing new features, increasing test
coverage and generally improving the code. And I welcome everyone to join me!

## How to donate

Use this button to donate one or multiple coffees, every coffee is worth $3!

**NOTE: If you have a pre 1.2 version of Vimari, you need to manually
update to the latest version as there is a bug in the auto-update code.
Versions post 1.2 will automatically update to the lastest version.**

Vimari - Keyboard Shortcuts extension for Safari
================================================

Vimari is a Safari extension that provides keyboard based navigation.
The code is heavily based on [vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium),
a Chrome extension that provides much more extensive features.

Vimari attempts to provide a lightweight port of vimium to Safari,
taking the best components of vimium and adapting them to Safari.

Usage
-----

### Settings
**Command Prefix** - Modifier key to hold down with your action key. If
you leave it blank you don't need to hold down anything (default
setting).

**Excluded URLs** - Comma separated list of website URLs you don't want
to use vimari with. To exclude GitHub for example, provide the value
`github.com` or `http://github.com`. It's smart and should handle all
possible domain cases though.

**Link Hint Characters** - Allowed characters to be used when generating
link shortcuts.

**Extra detection by cursor style** - Detect clickable links by looking
for HTML elements having cursor style set to "pointer".

**Scroll Size** - How much each scroll will move on the page.

### Keyboard Bindings
These are the default keyboard bindings, they can all be changed in the
settings of the extension. You can find them in
`Preferences->Extensions`.
