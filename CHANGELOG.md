## Changelog

### Unreleased

- Remove eager link hint triggering [#190](https://github.com/televator-apps/vimari/issues/190)
- Use `window.open` for `openNewTab` action [#189](https://github.com/televator-apps/vimari/issues/189)
- Add user customisation (based on the work of @nieldm [#163](https://github.com/televator-apps/vimari/pull/163)).
- Update Vimari interface to allow users access to their configuration.
- Remove `closeTabReverse` action.
- Normal mode now isolates keybindings from the underlying website, this means that to interact with the underlying website you need to enter insert mode.
- You can enter insert mode by pressing <kbd>i</kbd> and exit the mode by pressing <kbd>esc</kbd>. Activating either mode will display the HUD.
- In insert mode Vimari keybindings are disabled (except for <kbd>esc</kbd> which brings you back to normal mode) allowing you to interact with the underlying website.
- Add `goToFirstInput` action on <kbd>g i</kbd> by default (by [isundaylee](https://github.com/isundaylee)).
- Add smooth scrolling (based on sVim implementation).

### 2.0.3 (2019-09-26)

- Fix newTabHintToggle to use shift+f instead of F
- Implement forward tab and backward tab commands.
- Close tab with x is now implemented. Note that this relies on Safari's default behaviour to choose whether to switch to the left or right tab after closing the current tab.

### 2.0.2 (2019-09-23)

- Release a signed, notarized App and Safari App Extension
- Reverse link hints, so nearby links have different hints [#77](https://github.com/televator-apps/vimari/issues/77)
- Hide non-matching link hints [#79](https://github.com/televator-apps/vimari/issues/79)
- Show state of extension in main application

  version 12

### 1.13.0 (16/8/2018)

- New fresh icon

### 1.1 (31/07/2011)

- Updated to work with the new version of Safari on lion
- Removed history forward / back
- Changed directory structure to make it more developer friendly

### 0.4 (17/11/2010)

- First BETA release !
- Press ESC to enter a permanent state of 'non' insert mode. Clicking on any input then exits insert mode. This fixes several issues with google and facebook.

### 0.3 (16/11/2010)

- Moved the extension startup code to be loaded before the browser page. Events can now be intercepted before they are passed to the browser page.
- Created a manifest file, this allows automatic updates to take place.
- Added insert mode. If the selected node can accept an input, the extension is disabled. This functionality still needs some work.
- Ported the HUD from vimium. The hud displays information along the bottom of the screen. The hud has been ported but is not used for very much at the moment.

### 0.2 (14/11/2010)

- Pressing ESC now removes focus from any input fields and activates modifiers

### 0.1 (14/11/1020)
